Written for the Puppet Technical Challenge - Automate the installation and configuration of nginx web server]
-Karl Fezer 

REQUIREMENTS:

The nginx server must:

(a) serve requests over port 8000

(b) serve a page with the content of the following repository: https://github.com/puppetlabs/exercise-webpage (page from the repository must be served locally)

Your solution should:

(i) ensure that the required configuration is completed reliably when all the steps are completed

(ii) ensure that subsequent applications of the solution do not cause failures or repeat redundant configuration tasks

(iii) ensure that each execution of the solution results in nginx serving the latest available content from the repository linked above

|chmod +x puppetex.sh
to run file:
|sudo ./puppetex.sh
